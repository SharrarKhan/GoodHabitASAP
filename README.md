# GoodHabitASAP

The name of this project is GoodHabitASAP. I'm not entirely finished with the project however I still plan on working on it. This web app is a app where people can develop good habits on their own pace. A user will have a profile and will be able to add habits that he or she wants to develop. Whether it's to read five pages of a book before dinner daily or reminding themselves to eat a certain amount of calories during lunch daily, the user can add a habit that he or she wants to develop and the user will set a time where he or she will get a reminder via email. The user will be able to set what time he or she wants to recieve the email. The technologies that I used in this project are: PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.
